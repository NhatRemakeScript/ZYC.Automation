# ZYC.Automation

A high-performance, modular, and extensible desktop automation framework built with **.NET 10** and **WPF**.

ZYC.Automation integrates **.NET Aspire** for distributed application orchestration and supports a hybrid UI approach using **WebView2** and **Blazor**, enabling flexible composition of native desktop and web-based experiences.

## Key Features
- Modular, plugin-based architecture (dynamic loading, independent development)
- WPF desktop host with multi-workspace and multi-tab UI patterns
- Hybrid UI: WebView2 embedding + Blazor UI reuse
- Built-in task management, global exception handling, and localization support
- Aspire-ready orchestration and service management
